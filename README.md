# SBUS2-Telemetry Library
Arduino Library for receiving SBUS and SBUS2 Frames and transmit Telemetry Data 

- with Atmega328P MCU
  - The Library uses the U(S)ART Interrupt and Timer2
  - **You can't use Serial in your Sketch! Please use Softserial instead.**
- with ESP32
  - The Library uses Serial1 (UART_NUM_1) and TIMER_1 in TIMER_GROUP_0
  - RX1 = GPIO_NUM_25 and TX1 = GPIO_NUM_26
  - Serial, Timer and RX/TX Pins can be changed


## Setting up the Example Sketch
- Before you start flashing and coding, please Setup you Futaba Radio Control
  - Select Modulation-> FASSTest -> 14CH and bind your Receiver
  - You should see the SerialNumber of the Receiver
  - In Telemetry Screen, you should see the RX Voltage
  - Got to "Sensors" Menu and activate the Inactive Slots
  - See #defines in the example Sketch -> #define TEMPRATURE_SLOT   1 
  - Set Slot1 (Inactive) to Temp125 Sensor
  - Do the same with all other Sensors defined in the Example Sketch
- Build up you Arduino Hardware with Atmega328P
  - Build your Inverter Circuit
  - Flash the Sktech -> On Arduino Pro Mini you must flash without attached Inverter!
  - Attach The Inverter to RX and TX on the Arduino Board
  - Attach the Inverter to SBUS2 Port on your Receiver
- Build up you Arduino Hardware with ESP32
  - Place 1k between your RX1 and TX1 Pins
  - Attach the SBUS2 Port to RX1 Pin
  - Flash the Sktech
- Power up
  - You can power your Futaba Receiver from Arduino (5V)
  - Or you power your Arduino from Futaba Receiver (BEC)
  - You will See Telemetry Data on your Telemetry Screen
  
## Setting up a custom Sketch
You can't set every Sensor to every Slot!
There are Sensors which use 1 Slot and other Sensors use 3 or 8 Slots.

After receiving the SBUS Frame it's possible to transmit 8 Telemetry Slots.

There are 32 different Telemetry Slots available.

### Example
- Slot 0 is always RX Voltage-> So you cant use Slot0 for custom Sensors
- So you have 7 Slots left (Slot 1 to Slot 7)
- So you cant use a 8 Slot Sensor (GPS) on Slot 1!
- GPS has to be on Slot 8, or Slot 16, or Slot 24
- On Slot 1 you could set a Temperature Sensor (1 Slot Sensor)
- On Slot 2 you could set a RPM Sensor (1 Slot Sensor)
- On Slot 3 you could set a Power Sensor (3 Slot Sensor)
- The Power Sensor uses Slot 3, Slot 4 and Slot 5 (3 Slot's!)
- The next free Slot would be Slot 6
- Slot 6 can't be a Power Sensor, because you have just 2 Slots free!

### The easiest Way for a Working Setup
- First set all Sensors in your Futaba Radio Control
- Your Futaba System will keep the things clear.
- After you set up all your Favorit Sensors in your Radio, you can #define the used Slot's in the Sketch
- Take a look which Radio support which Sensor [PDF](https://github.com/BrushlessPower/SBUS2-Telemetry/blob/master/futaba-sensors.pdf)

### Structure
You can use every Sensor as often you want. But you have a maximum of 31 Sensor Slots
If yo want to have multiple Temp Sensors, just change the Slot Number:
 - send_temp125(TEMPRATURE_SLOT1, (int16_t)50);
 - send_temp125(TEMPRATURE_SLOT2, (int16_t)80);
 - send_temp125(TEMPRATURE_SLOT3, (int16_t)20);
 - send_temp125(TEMPRATURE_SLOT4, (int16_t)999);
- The same for all other Sensors
The Sensor Values are updated with your Loop() cycle time.
 - If your loop() contains a Delay(2000), your Telemetry Data will be updated every 2sek
 - If your loop() has no Delay's, your Telemetry Data will be updated every 60ms (every 4 SBUS Frames)
 - The Servo Channel Data is updated every 15ms (with every new SBUS(2) Frame)
 
## Stand alone SBUS Library
This Library can be used just for getting Servo Channel Data. The Library just send telemetry Data to SBUS2 compatible Receiver.
 - SBUS_Ready() -> True when new Servo data is received with SBUS and SBUS2 Frames
 - SBUS2_Ready() -> True when SBUS2 Frames are received
 - SBUS2_get_status() will also work with just SBUS Frames

## Guide for Library Development
The Futaba Telemetry Protocol has very hard Timings:
- Slot 0 must be send 2ms after the last Byte of the SBUS(2) Frame 
- same for Slot 8, Slot 16 and Slot 24
- After every Slot's there must be 325µs Pause to the next Slot
- So you have to receive the SBUS Frame in a UART Interrupt
- And with the Last Byte of the Frame you have to Start a Timer with 2ms
- With every Timer Interrupt you have to set the next Timer Interrupt to 660µs
- If the Timer doesn't work in this conditions, you do not need to start developing the Slot data transmission
- You need to have a Logic Analyser or Oscilloscope
- The best way is to toggle some Pins to check the correct timing
- SBUS(2) Level Voltage is 3,3V -> Do not work with 5V Level Signals!

## Aditional Informations about Futaba's SBUS and SBUS2
- SBUS(2) is 100000 Baud with 8 data bits, even parity and 2 stop bits
- SBUS(2) Signal is inverted UART
- SBUS is a Frame with 25 Bytes
  - Byte [0] is 0x0F
  - Byte [1-22] is Servo Channel Data
  - Byte [23] is DigiChannel 17&18 + Stus Bits
  - Byte [24] is 0x00
- SBUS2 is a SBUS Frame but with a diffent End Byte (Byte24)
  - Byte [24] is 0x04, 0x14, 0x24, 0x34
  - Byte 24 controls the Number of the Telemetry Slot's
    - 0x04 -> Slot 0 to Slot 7
    - 0x14 -> Slot 8 to Slot 15
    - 0x24 -> Slot 16 to Slot 23
    - 0x34 -> Slot 24 to Slot 31
